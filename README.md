# Arrhythpy

**Arrhythpy** is an open-source Python-based program designed to quantify and classify arrhythmias in calcium transients in an automated manner. See the corresponding paper at [link to paper] for a detailed explanation.

## Installation

### Easiest Way

The easiest way to use Arrhythpy is to download the precompiled zip file that contains the executable. To this end, go to 'Releases'. Ensure you install the correct version for your operating system:
- **Windows:** `Arrhythpy_win`
- **Mac:** `Arrhythpy_ios`

This executable should run independently without needing to install Python.

### Alternative Installation

If the precompiled version does not work, please refer to the manual for alternative installation methods.
